# PM2.5-Emissions-Data
 Assignment: Exploratory Data Analysis_Course Project_2

1. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

The total emissions is generally decreased.(plot1)

2. Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

The total emissions is generally decreased.(plot2)
However, the emission in 2005 was increased from that in 2002.


3. Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

All the four types of sources shows that the emission is decreased.(plot3)
The type of "point" shows the greatest decreases in emission over time.

4. Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

THe emission form coal combustion-related is increased over time accoss the US.(plot4)

5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?

THe emission form coal combustion-related is decreased over time in Baltimore.(plot5)

6. Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

Los Angeles shows greater changes than Baltimore in emission from moter veheicle over time.(plot6)
